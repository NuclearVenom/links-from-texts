# links-from-texts
link-extractor.py is the main program.
It is a GUI program that was made with the help of chatgpt.com. 
It allows user to paste text containing multiple links. As the name suggests, it extracts all the links from the text and open each link automatically in new tabs.
The extracted links are also saves in a text file that is generated after the program runs. 
Note: only the most recent links will be present in the text file. The previous links will be deleted.
